# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview
Unsupervised machine learning is a powerful tool that allows us to cluster or determine similar patterns in datasets. In this project, we used the scikit-learn library to group cryptocurrency data with the K-means algorithm. However, before we could cluster the data, we had to clean the data and then reduce the dimensionality with principal component analysis to decrease the number of features in our data. Feature reduction entails transforming our data to capture the variables that contain the most relevant information in our data. By reducing the number of features, we can optimize our machine learning algorithms and improve visualizations by decreasing the number of axes used. We then created an elbow curve to determine how many clusters we should use for our K-means algorithm. Using K-means clustering, we were able to group similar cryptocurrencies based on their principal components and then visualize the results. The purpose of the project was to better understand the cryptocurrency ecosystem and the uses of unsupervised machine learning.
